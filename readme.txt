== Description ==
Shareaholic has proven time and time again to be an extremely useful and successful tool in getting your readers to actually **submit your articles** to numerous social bookmarking sites. 

Our sole aim was to stray away from the "in the box" thinking behind most social bookmarking plugins, and add a little flair that would entice your readers, rather than deterring them with microscopic icons that get lost in pages heavy laden with content.
